# Challenge 01 - Javascript

This project is a simple web-based application created to perform basic arithmetic operations on two user-input numbers. It also includes checks for specific conditions like whether the sum is even and if the two numbers are equal.

## Features

- **User Input**: Prompts the user to input two numbers.
- **Calculations**: Performs the following operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (with a check for division by zero)
  - Remainder of division (with a check for division by zero)
- **Conditions**:
  - Checks if the sum of the two numbers is even or odd.
  - Checks if the two numbers are equal or different.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the JavaScript code for the challenge.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. You will be prompted to enter two numbers.
3. After entering the numbers, the results of the arithmetic operations will be displayed on the screen:
   - The sum, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder of the division.
   - A message indicating whether the sum is even or odd.
   - A message indicating whether the two numbers are equal or different.

## Technologies Used
